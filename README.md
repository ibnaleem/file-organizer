# File Organizer
A script that helps you organize your files on your computer.

Before getting started, please ensure that you have the following prerequisites:
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/): Make sure you have the [latest version of Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed on your computer. You can verify the installation by running the following command in your command prompt or terminal:
```shell
$ python --version
``` 
- Admin Privileges: You need to have administrator privileges on your computer to execute the script successfully.

Please note that some anti-virus software may flag the script due to its file manipulation capabilities. To avoid any interruptions, it is recommended to add the script to your anti-virus exclusion list or whitelist. This will prevent the anti-virus software from blocking or interfering with the script's execution. In other words, files are moving too quickly and hence flag your anti-virus - we don't want that :)

# Instructions
